		<li>{% trans "<strong>Global Consensus:</strong> A communal decision on a matter relating to the whole RCL Network, such as changes to the DCI, made by all current residents of all RCLs everywhere through a collection of Community Consensuses. A Global Consensus can be proposed by any face-to-face RCL Vision Council which can be held anywhere, anytime by anyone. A proposal will become a Global Consensus Request once it has reached Community Consensus in any RCL and has been published on our RCL Common Website by that RCL’s Internet Focalizer. All RCLs are themselves responsible for obtaining information about Global Consensus Requests. All RCLs have two moon cycles to respond to a Global Consensus Request but will be granted an extension of an additional moon cycle if requested. All RCLs automatically “stand aside” if they fail to respond within this time limit. The Community Consensuses will be collected on our RCL Common Website. Global Consensus is reached after two moon cycles if all RCLs are in agreement." %}</li>
